# GitHub Copilot custom agents — E-commerce

The two version-controlled profiles in `.github/agents/` are **configuration**, not proof that an interactive Copilot session was executed. They can be selected in supported GitHub Copilot interfaces once the profile is visible to the user's entitlement and repository policies.

| Agent file | Task scope | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commerce-dbt-integrity.agent.md` | dbt staging/intermediate/marts, revenue/return correctness, first-touch attribution, tests | Synthetic/local-first, no BigQuery or CI |
| `commerce-powerbi-evidence.agent.md` | DAX/model lineage, Power BI screenshot provenance and theme QA | No invented PBIX/PBIP, render, refresh or screenshot |

## How to select

On GitHub.com, start a supported Copilot coding-agent task in this repository and choose the custom agent in the agent selector. In a supported IDE, select it from the Copilot agents dropdown. In the Copilot CLI use `/agent` to choose a profile; repository configuration may require restarting the client or refreshing the selector.

**The agents will not run continuously on their own.** Both are manually invocable and have model-triggered invocation disabled. A PR/merge requires an authorized user or an explicitly delegated workflow. Merely merging the files does not run a Copilot agent.

## Manual smoke-test prompts (no CI)

1. Select **Commerce dbt Integrity** and ask: "Read `fct_order_marketing.sql` and `tests/fct_order_marketing_status_reconciliation.sql`. Explain the order-item grain, how a returned item affects revenue, and which test would catch a stale return amount. Do not modify any file or run remote commands." Expected: correct status-based metric logic and explicit test limitations.
2. Use the same agent: "Compare BigQuery and DuckDB branches of `fct_marketing_web_performance.sql`. Confirm how session traffic source and browser first touch are ordered and how `unknown` is skipped. Only inspect sources." Expected: event-ID final tiebreak and accurate session-grain explanation.
3. Select **Commerce Power BI Evidence**: "Can we claim `powerbi/themes/nexus-commerce.json` has been applied to a current editable report? What proof is missing?" Expected: **no**, because the editable PBIX/PBIP and actual Desktop refresh/render evidence are absent.
4. With the evidence agent: "Explain why `dim_user.signup_traffic_source` cannot be used interchangeably with `fct_marketing_web_performance.traffic_source`, and what `B` means on historical Turkish screenshots." Expected: acquisition versus session attribution, and `B=thousand`.

If a client is available locally and the repository is checked out, existing offline checks include:

```bash
python scripts/check_order_fact_refresh.py
python scripts/check_order_fact_invariants.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_session_first_touch_order.py'
```

Do **not** interpret a successful YAML/frontmatter check or these Python checks as evidence that a Copilot session, BigQuery dbt run, or Power BI Desktop review has completed. CI providers are out of scope.

## Offline profile policy regression

The repository includes a **stdlib-only** policy checker and synthetic unit tests:

```bash
python scripts/check_copilot_agents.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_copilot_agent_profiles.py'
```

The checker requires a repository instruction file, a unique agent name, nonempty prompts, explicit `read/search` tool permissions, no unrestricted or unknown tools, opt-in to repository instruction inheritance for CLI subagents, manual selection, and no automatic cloud-agent invocation. Run it against another checked-out repository with `python scripts/check_copilot_agents.py --root ../OTHER_REPO`. This script intentionally parses only the **flat frontmatter** pattern used by our custom agents; do not treat it as a general YAML validator or as proof of a working GitHub Copilot session. If other YAML features are introduced, extend the parser and tests first.

The existing agents also use `edit` and `execute` for narrow, offline source and test changes. Those aliases are not a hard sandbox, so users should review the tools and permissions available in their Copilot client and approve any proposed changes. The agent prompts explicitly disallow remote CI or other paid service invocation.

## Review and acceptance record

- [x] Two agent definitions committed under standard repository paths.
- [x] Repository-wide Copilot instructions present.
- [x] Offline QA scenario prompts documented.
- [ ] Actual Copilot agent appears and can be selected in the user's client.
- [ ] Both agents answer the four smoke-test prompts as expected.
- [ ] Full dbt tests and editable Power BI report visual QA — independent release gates.

Record a real client run, selected agent, date, test prompt and observed output here only after it happens.
