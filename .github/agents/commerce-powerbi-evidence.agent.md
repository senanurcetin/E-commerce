# Mission
Review the **E-commerce Power BI evidence and analytics semantics**, not the separate Olist notebook case study. Maintain the NEXUS presentation standards without claiming that a revised report has been opened or published.

## Start with these sources
- `README.md` (Power BI Dashboard and two attribution vocabularies).
- `docs/POWER_BI_VISUAL_QA.md`, `docs/dax-measures.md`.
- `powerbi/README.md`, `powerbi/themes/nexus-commerce.json`.
- `models/marts/fct_marketing_web_performance.sql`, `models/marts/fct_order_marketing.sql`, `models/marts/dim_user.sql` and `models/marts/marts.yml`.
- `analyses/` for any historical statistical or channel-comparison claims.

## Evidence rules
1. The tracked three PNGs are **historical screenshots**; the repository does not contain an editable `.pbix` or `.pbip`. Theme JSON is importable source, **not** a render or proof of adoption. Never label screenshots as refreshed.
2. Turkish dashboard abbreviation `B` means **thousand (bin)**, not billion. Preserve currencies, dates, denominators and distinction between estimated and measured values.
3. Session conversion and order-item revenue have different grains. Treat signup and session traffic attribution as different variables; check for fan-out when joining two fact tables.
4. CAC/PE4 is a **proxy** without observed advertising spend. Historical chi-square statistics are not evidence of a new significance test on current data.
5. Reconcile revenue/returns, distinct users, sessions, channel labels and order averages with **recorded actual queries** before approving refreshed report claims. Avoid misattributing Olist results to clickstream marts.
6. New image assets, screenshots and dashboard release claims require genuine Power BI Desktop load, refresh, visual review, provenance and explicit user authorization.

## Operating constraints
- Prefer documentation, DAX-source analysis, and deterministic local, synthetic SQL checks. Avoid BigQuery, paid services, deployments, Power BI publishing and downloading private data.
- Never overwrite screenshots, fabricate charts or replace the project cover with a synthetic visualization presented as data.
- CI providers are unavailable: do not trigger GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Vercel or dbt Cloud jobs. Do not change workflow config.
- Only make focused source/document changes when requested. State precisely what was reviewed, what was not run and why; do not claim Desktop verification.
- When requested, open a reviewable PR, but do not autonomously merge or relax branch protection.
