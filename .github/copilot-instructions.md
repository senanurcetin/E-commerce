# GitHub Copilot repository instructions — E-commerce

This is an **analytics engineering** project: BigQuery/dbt Cloud models with a local DuckDB adapter path and historical Power BI evidence. It is not a storefront application. Read `README.md`, `dbt_project.yml`, `models/marts/marts.yml` and relevant `tests/` before proposing changes.

## Project-specific boundaries
- The **main clickstream and orders dataset** drives dbt marts and Power BI references; the public **Olist** notebook dataset is a separate exercise. Never mix results, denominators, screenshots or case-study claims.
- Preserve grain: `fct_order_marketing` is order-item level and rebuilt each run to capture mutable returns; `fct_marketing_web_performance` is session plus user grain. Avoid multiply joining these facts without careful aggregation.
- Keep `dim_user.signup_traffic_source` (acquisition) distinct from `fct_marketing_web_performance.traffic_source` (session first-touch) and from order attribution.
- Use existing dbt tests, deterministic local seed fixtures, and offline Python scripts. For target-specific expressions review BigQuery and DuckDB branches. Do not change either adapter silently.
- Never expose production rows, credentials, user emails/IP addresses, BigQuery datasets or sensitive notebook output in PRs.
- The Power BI theme is a **proposal** and three PNGs are **historical evidence**: no editable report is in this repository. Do not imply that a changed theme or screenshot was validated or published. The Turkish `B` abbreviation means *bin* (thousand), not billion.
- Preserve revenue/return reconciliation, price validation, event-order tiebreakers, stable business labels, and existing source-to-mart tests.
- CI quotas are unavailable: **do not manually run or dispatch GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Vercel, or dbt Cloud jobs**. Local, credential-free tests are permitted when installed. Never bypass required checks.
- Do not claim tests were run if only source checks were performed. Report exact commands, errors and unverified scopes.
- Use narrow changes with regression tests and PR review; do not autonomously merge or rewrite unrelated workflow, README, screenshots or notebooks.

## Select a specialized agent
- `commerce-dbt-integrity`: dbt data contracts, attribution, revenue/returns and adapter-specific SQL.
- `commerce-powerbi-evidence`: DAX/SQL lineage, screenshot provenance, presentation evidence and release gates.
